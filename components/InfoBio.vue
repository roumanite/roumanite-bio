        Hi! I'm Grace Ariel.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer specializing in web development.
        I moved to Singapore in 2016, where I studied computer science and cyber forensics.
        Three years later, I began my career as a software engineer at a startup focused on automating logistics operations.

        This experience was a gateway into the professional world, allowing me to grow both personally and professionally.
        In the collaborative and supportive environment of a startup, I learned how to work effectively in a team, communicate ideas and arrive at solutions,
        all while pursuing my own career goals and contributing to the company's success.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenges brought on by the pandemic taught me adaptability, resilience, and the importance of compromise and understanding during tough times.
        Additionally, I gained valuable insights into the logistics and supply chain industry and how our startup fit into the broader market.

        A key milestone in my career was joining Sephora SEA, where I became part of a diverse and dynamic community.
        Sephora's commitment to beauty, diversity, and inclusion is reflected in its workplace culture and the way it values its employees.
        I had the opportunity to work with a large technology team of 60+ people, learn from inspiring colleagues, and engage in social events.
        As a member of the ERP squad, we successfully transformed Sephora into an omni-channel retailer, enhancing its ability to offer a seamless and personalized shopping experience.

        I'm grateful to have a career that allows me to do the work I care about, gives me the freedom to be myself,
        and fosters continuous learning. I am always seeking opportunities that align with my values and support both my professional growth and my personal purpose of contributing to society.
        If you'd like to collaborate, feel free to reach out - it would be an honor to work with you.
